    <h5> ACT 3 ,SCENE I: </h5>
    <h6> The wood. TITANIA lying asleep.
        Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING
        BOTTOM
        Are we all met?
        QUINCE
        Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal.
        This green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house;
        and we will do it in action as we will do it before the duke.
        BOTTOM
        Peter Quince,--
        QUINCE
        What sayest thou, bully Bottom?
        BOTTOM
        There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and
        Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must
        draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies
        cannot abide. How answer you that?
        SNOUT
        By'r lakin, a parlous fear.
        STARVELING
        I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.
        BOTTOM
        Not a whit: I have a device to make all well.
        Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to say, 
        we will do no harm with our swords, and that
        Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more better assurance,
        tell them that I, Pyramus, am not
        Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them out of fear.
        QUINCE
        Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be
        written in eight and six.
        BOTTOM
        No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.
        SNOUT
        Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?
        STARVELING
        I fear it, I promise you.
        BOTTOM
        Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to
        bring in--God shield us!--a lion among ladies, is a
        most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful
        wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to
        look to 't.
        SNOUT
        Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.
        BOTTOM
        Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must
        be seen through the lion's neck: and he himself
        must speak through, saying thus, or to the same
        defect,--'Ladies,'--or 'Fair-ladies--I would wish
        You,'--or 'I would request you,'--or 'I would
entreat you,--not to fear, not to tremble: my life
for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it
were pity of my life: no I am no such thing; I am a
man as other men are;' and there indeed let him name
his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.
QUINCE
Well it shall be so. But there is two hard things;
that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for,
you know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight.
SNOUT
Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?
BOTTOM
A calendar, a calendar! look in the almanac; find
out moonshine, find out moonshine.
QUINCE
Yes, it doth shine that night.
BOTTOM
Why, then may you leave a casement of the great
chamber window, where we play, open, and the moon
may shine in at the casement.
QUINCE
Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns
and a lanthorn, and say he comes to disfigure, or to
present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is
another thing: we must have a wall in the great
chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby says the story, did
talk through the chink of a wall.
SNOUT
You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?
BOTTOM
Some man or other must present Wall: and let him
have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast
about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his
fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus
and Thisby whisper.
QUINCE
If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down,
every mother's son, and rehearse your parts.
Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your
speech, enter into that brake: and so every one
according to his cue.
Enter PUCK behind

PUCK
What hempen home-spuns have we swaggering here,
So near the cradle of the fairy queen?
What, a play toward! I'll be an auditor;
An actor too, perhaps, if I see cause.
QUINCE
Speak, Pyramus. Thisby, stand forth.
BOTTOM
Thisby, the flowers of odious savours sweet,--
QUINCE
Odours, odours.
BOTTOM
--odours savours sweet:
So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby dear.
But hark, a voice! stay thou but here awhile,
And by and by I will to thee appear.
Exit

PUCK
A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here.
Exit

FLUTE
Must I speak now?
QUINCE
Ay, marry, must you; for you must understand he goes
but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again.
FLUTE
Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,
Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,
Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew,
As true as truest horse that yet would never tire,
I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb.
QUINCE
'Ninus' tomb,' man: why, you must not speak that
yet; that you answer to Pyramus: you speak all your
part at once, cues and all Pyramus enter: your cue
is past; it is, 'never tire.'
FLUTE
O,--As true as truest horse, that yet would
never tire.
Re-enter PUCK, and BOTTOM with an ass's head

BOTTOM
If I were fair, Thisby, I were only thine.
